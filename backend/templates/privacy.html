            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>Last updated: November 19, 2025</strong></p>
            <p>SafeIMEI ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our platform. Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the site.</p>

            <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>We collect information in three primary ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public IMEI Check:</strong> When you search for an IMEI, we do not collect your personal data. We may temporarily log IP addresses solely for security and rate-limiting purposes.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Online Theft Reporting:</strong> When you submit a theft report directly through our website, we collect:
                    <ul class="list-circle ml-5 mt-2">
                        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Your full name, phone number, email address, and physical address.</li>
                        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> IMEI number, brand, model, and color.</li>
                        <li><strong>Verification Documents:</strong> We collect digital copies of your Government ID (NIN, PVC, Passport) and Proof of Ownership (Receipt/Box) to verify your claim.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Police Station Reports:</strong> Information collected by officers at physical stations is also securely stored in our database for the purpose of device recovery.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>The information collected is used for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To operate the National Stolen Device Database.</li>
                <li>To facilitate the verification of stolen property by Law Enforcement Officers.</li>
                <li>To provide the public with instant IMEI status checks (Stolen/Clean).</li>
                <li>To contact you regarding the status of your report or recovery of your device.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Security and Sharing</h3>
            <p>Protecting your information is our highest priority.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strict Access Control:</strong> Your sensitive documents (ID Cards and Receipts) are <strong>strictly confidential</strong>. They are viewable ONLY by authorized Police Officers and System Administrators for verification purposes. They are never made public.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Data:</strong> Only the device details (IMEI, Model, and Status) are publicly searchable. Your name and contact details are NEVER displayed to the public.</li>
                <li><strong>Law Enforcement Cooperation:</strong> By submitting a report, you consent to sharing your data with the Nigerian Police Force for investigation and recovery purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Retention</h3>
            <p>We retain report information as long as it is necessary to provide our services. If a device is marked as "Recovered," the public "stolen" flag is removed, but the official record may be retained for law enforcement history.</p>

            <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
